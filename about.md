# Hello

I'm a junior at MIT pursuing computer science and mathematics. 
I'm a big fan of Lisp, Material Design, and [Bret Victor](https://worrydream.com), 
although Smalltalk, Comic Sans, and Alan Kay are close respective seconds. 
I can recite most [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) comics from memory 
(including the alt-text) and love petty semantic debates. 

I care about a lot of Big Ideas, and want to make computing universally 
accessible to everyone as a medium and an art. I believe in 
[direct manipulation of data](https://vimeo.com/66085662), 
[augmenting human intellect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos), 
and [dynamic, interactive documents](http://www.xanadu.net/), 
unlike most of the ones you'll find here.

Some of my projects are kind of weird (that's deliberate) and some
of my heroes are kind of eccentric (that's unfortunate), but hopefully 
they make you think a little bit.

> There is no 'Technology'. There is no 'Design'. There is only a vision of how mankind should be, and the relentless resolve to make it so.

 - Bret Victor
   - "There is no 'Technology'. There is no 'Design'. 
     There is only a vision of how mankind should be, and the relentless resolve to make it so."
 - Alan Kay
   - "The visual arts are the imitation of life, but the computing arts are the imitation of creation itself."
 - Doug Engelbart
   - "The key thing about all the world's big problems is that they have 
     to be dealt with collectively. If we don't get collectively smarter, we're doomed."
 - Ted Nelson
   - "Most people are fools, most authority is malignant, God does not exist, and everything is wrong."
 - Gerry Sussman
   - "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute"

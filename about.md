I'm a junior at MIT pursuing computer science and mathematics.
I'm a big fan of Lisp, Alan Kay, and Bret Victor, and tend to overuse words like "relation", "projection", and "space".
I can recite most [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) comics from memory (including the alt-text) and love petty semantic debates.

I care about a lot of Big Ideas, and want to make computing universally accessible to everyone as a medium and an art.
I believe in direct manipulation of data, augmenting human intellect, and dynamic, interactive documents, unlike most of the ones you'll find here.

Some of my projects are a bit weird (that's deliberate) and some of my heroes are a bit eccentric (that's unfortunate).
I only hope they're thought-provoking.

# Work

## is this subtitle sufficiently Medium?

### MIT Media Lab

I joined the [Viral Communications Group](http://viral.media.mit.edu/) as an undergraduate researcher in 2015.
I've worked on several projects, mostly with visualizations, interface design, and information network architecture.

[PubPub (2016)](http://pubpub.org)
: PubPub is a platform for free and open publishing.
  PubPub emphasizes radical transparency, hosts curated grassroots journals, and weaves a connected mesh of rich, digitally native documents.
  I worked on interactive visualizations and [Xanadu](http://xanadu.com)-style transclusions.

[Super Glue (2015)](http://viral.pubpub.org/pub/super-glue)
: Super Glue is a digestion system and metadata generator for mass media.
  I wrote some metadata extraction modules, designed a [media exploration dashboard](http://super-glue-dashboard.herokuapp.com), and prototyped [demo applications](http://viral.pubpub.org/pub/super-cuts).

### MIT CSAIL

In summer 2016 I started working with [Gerry Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman) and [Jack Wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Wisdom) to redesign the online notes, simulations, and demos for [6.946: Computational Classical Mechanics](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/).
In fall 2016, I joined the [Software Design Group](http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/) as the Keel Foundation Undergraduate Research and Innovation Scholar (wow).
I'm working on an object-oriented spreadsheet programming interface and a new way to compose relational expressions.

# Heroes

## ye legends of olde

These are just a few of the people who continually inspire me with the depth of their perception and the extent of their vision.
Maybe someday we'll realize their dreams, but until then, with ideas that are still radical, we fight on.

[Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay)
: "The visual arts are the imitation of life, but the computing arts are the imitation of creation itself."

[Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com)
: "There is no 'Technology'. There is no 'Design'.
  There is only a vision of how mankind should be, and the relentless resolve to make it so."

[Doug Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart)
: "The key thing about all the world's big problems is that they have
  to be dealt with collectively. If we don't get collectively smarter, we're doomed."

[Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson)
: "Most people are fools, most authority is malignant, God does not exist, and everything is wrong."

[Gerry Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman)
: "Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."

# Courses

## past, present, and the tentative future

Check out my complete [road map](https://courseroad.mit.edu/#joelg), complete with degree audit details.
I'm (usually) Course 6-3, Courses 6-3 \& 18G, or just Course 18C, depending on the phase of the moon and the observed states of entangled roommates.

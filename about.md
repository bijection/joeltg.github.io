Hi! I'm a sophomore at MIT pursuing computer science and mathematics. 
I'm a big fan of Lisp, Material Design, and Bret Victor, although Smalltalk, Comic Sans, and Ted Nelson are close respective seconds. 
I can recite most xkcd comics from memory (including the alt-text) and love petty semantic debates. 

I care about a lot of Big Ideas, and want to make computing universally accessible to everyone as a medium and an art. 
Some of my projects are kind of weird - that's deliberate - but hopefully they make you think a little bit.

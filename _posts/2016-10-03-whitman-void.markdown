there's a whitman poem i hate
<br>
the purported answer; the contributed verse
<br>
but a larger script is a playground of inconsequence

instead i see a symmetry
<br>
a vast nothing with magic in it
<br>
a principle of explosion

"meaningless" is the power to mean anything
<br>
drawing creation from the void is its own validation
<br>
i can steer my boat if not the sea

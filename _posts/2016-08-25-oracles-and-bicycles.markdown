There are three classes of levers, but some are more similar than others.

First-class levers balance the fulcrum between the effort and load, like this:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/LeverFirstClass.png" />

First-class levers use the pivot to change the mechanical advantage of the effort, and also the direction of the resultant force.

Second- and third-class levers look like this (respectively):

<div class="img-center">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/LeverSecondClass.png" />
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/LeverThirdClass.png" />
</div>

Second- and third-class levers still change the input's mechanical advantage, but don't affect its direction.
In fact, the concepts of "input" and "output" aren't very applicable here: first-class levers *react to input*, but these levers just transform a force that *passes through* them.

There are two kinds of Google searches.
This is (of course) a flagrant generalization, but we've all enjoyed a silent chuckle while watching a grandparent laboriously spell out "What is the weather like in Boston right now?" as we doodle "boston weather" into our phones under the table.
Even though they get the same result, it takes longer, and (more importantly) just *feels* wrong.
To us, it betrays a sort of naivety about what search engines are, and how to use them.
Google is an engine to be operated with keywords, not an oracle to be queried in complete, meticulously punctuated sentences.
Right?

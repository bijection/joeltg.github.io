There are three classes of levers, but some are more similar than others.

First-class levers balance the fulcrum between the effort and load, like this:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/LeverFirstClass.png" />

First-class levers use the pivot to change the mechanical advantage of the effort, and also the direction of the resultant force.

Second- and third-class levers look like this (respectively):

<div class="img-center">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/LeverSecondClass.png" />
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/LeverThirdClass.png" />
</div>

Second- and third-class levers still change the input's mechanical advantage, but don't affect its direction.
In fact, the concepts of "input" and "output" aren't very applicable here: first-class levers *react to input*, but these levers just transform a force that *passes through* them.

There are two kinds of Google searches.
This is (of course) a flagrant generalization, but we've all enjoyed a silent chuckle while watching a grandparent laboriously spell out "What is the weather like in Boston right now?" as we doodle "boston weather" into our phones under the table.
Even though they get the same result, it takes longer, and (more importantly) just *feels* wrong.
To us, it seems to betray a sort of naivety about what search engines are, and how to use them.
Google is an engine to be operated with keywords, not an oracle to be queried in complete, meticulously punctuated sentences.
Right?

As keyboards get smarter, "spellcheck" is becoming obsolete.
It's not because we're spelling better, but rather writing better: autocorrect is letting people not even spell anything at all!
This is *awesome*.
Spellcheck, while better than nothing, embodies a very violent UX pattern.
It has no flow.
It interrupts.
It implies that misspelling a word is some sort of wrongdoing, instead of a natural part of the writing process.
It's pure, retroactive error correction and still requires its own deliberate action to dismiss.

This is in sharp contrast with autocorrect.
Instead of retroactive correction, autocorrect is proactive prediction, which is much less disruptive. 
Autocorrect is a 5- to 10-character window into the future, and it's constructive in every way that spellcheck is destrictive.

So here's the common thread: there's a very qualitative distinction between oracles and biycles.
Oracles are very Q&A, very I/O, very call-and-response.
Bicycles are very direct, very fluid, very analog.
Bicycles expand the range of what a human can do; oracles do something that a human tells them to do.
Oracles receive a command, go do something else somewhere else, and maybe come back and return a result.
Bicycles integrate into our own selves.
Pedals are just extensions of our feet; racquets are extensions of our arms; search engines are extensions of our memories.
But oracles are their own "thing", a independent entity, and a foreigner that has to be communicated *with*.

This isn't to say that oracles are inherently wrong or that bicycles are always better. But there's a huge difference between truly *augmenting* a human and merely *interfacing* with one.
It's important to know exacly which class of lever

this table of numbers seems awfully important
<br>
like ornaments we unbox ancient stats
<br>
drape our feeds and walls in ritual fervor
<br>
are your gods republicans or democrats?

tomorrow: scattered showers of fire and brimstone
<br>
flurries of accusations and tension and fear
<br>
election day is happening and
<br>
it's the most wonderful time of the year

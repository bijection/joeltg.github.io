the self at the wheel needs an inner self of its own
<br>
a recursive factorial never really exists
<br>
there's a Y combinator of consciousness to seal the illusion
<br>
self-loops need no base case; only inductive steps
<br>
recursion is only infinite from one perspective
<br>
it's turtles all the way around

Modern browsers lose rich information when they compress browsing 
history into a linear stack, which makes backtracking from a forest of 
links surprisingly difficult.  We can do better.

## Introduction

Visual History is a Chrome extension in collaboration with 
[Kenny Friedman](http://kennethfriedman.org) that delinearizes your 
browsing history with a richer alternative to the Back and Forward 
buttons. Instead of a stack of previously visited destinations, Visual 
History maintains the forest of trees that represent each tabâ€™s path 
around the internet, and lets you easily backtrack to any site you've 
recently visited.

This solves an [ancient problem](https://xkcd.com/214/) with Wikipedia.

## Motivation

Back and Forward buttons are simple and convenient, but the underlying
history stack is a terrible model for navigation. Websites aren't stops
on a subway line; they're nodes in a connected graph. Even within this 
graph, we rarely just wander down one winding path: we backtrack
from articles to homepages, from links to search results, and from 
threads to forums. The internet is a graph, and we tend to browse 
hierarchically.

But browsers make hierarchical navigation very difficult. Going back to
a page of search results and down to a sibling link "destroys" the original
link in the back/forward stack. This is bad for a couple reasons:

 - Since we can "lose" a link if we're not careful, we assume the mental
   load of tracking our history ourselves, so that we know when it's 
   "safe" to go down a new branch, or when we might want to save our 
   "place" for later. Design should minimize mental load, not add state 
   to the userspace.
 - When it's not safe to go down a new branch, and faced with the threat
   of losing a page to which we may want to return, we usually resort to
   ridiculous hacks like *opening links in new tabs*.

That second effect is subtle. "Tabs" organize content
categorically. That *is* the tab metaphor. But more often than not,
browsers reduce tabs to a scattered breadcrumb trail of abandoned
siblings - links that we popped open because it was inconvenient (or
dangerous) to navigate to them directly. These new tabs don't have any 
idea where they are in the internet - we can't go back from them, and we 
sometimes forget how we got there in the first place - but *dammit, at 
least we can Ctrl-Tab between them quickly!* Not only is this both
computationally and spatially wasteful, it's also confusing and antipattern. 
It's just bad design.

## Usage

Navigate around the graph by clicking the graph icon in the toolbar, or 
by using Ctrl + arrow key (or Cmd + arrow key for Mac) shortcuts. When 
Ctrl (or Cmd) is released, Chrome will navigate to whichever node is 
currently selected.

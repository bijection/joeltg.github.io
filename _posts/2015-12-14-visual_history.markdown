Modern browsers lose rich information when they compress browsing 
history into a linear stack, which makes backtracking from a forest of 
links surprisingly difficult.  We can do better.

Visual History is a Chrome extension I made with 
[Kenny Friedman](http://kennethfriedman.org") that delinearizes your 
browsing history with a richer alternative to the Back and Forward 
buttons. Instead of a stack of previously visited destinations, Visual 
History maintains the forest of trees that represent each tabâ€™s path 
around the internet, and lets you easily backtrack to any site you've 
recently visited. You can find it on [GitHub](http://github.com/joeltg/visual_history)
and the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/visual-history/nkckokcpjekkokllfplejfkocaikmnml)

Trees are local to each tab, and are deleted once the tab is closed.

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>
<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/7A7JwhN-zbU' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

This solves [an ancient problem](https://xkcd.com/214/) with Wikipedia.

Routes that normally have to be manually re-traced by users, like 
jumping between search results or forum posts, can now be intuitively 
and quickly directed without revisiting the parent page.

You can also push a link to the tree in the background without actually 
visiting the page.

## Usage

Navigate around the graph by clicking the graph icon in the toolbar, or by using Ctrl + arrow key shortcuts. Whatever node is selected when Ctrl is released will be navigated to.

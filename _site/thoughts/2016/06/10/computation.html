    <p>“Computation” is a slippery mathematical idea. In the same way that we 
only glimpse algorithmic complexity by the shadows it casts on time and 
space, we only interact with computation through little  projections 
like “Turing machines” or “Python scripts” that are just tiny peepholes 
into the raw, fluid information-space beyond.</p>

<p>From this obscured view, it’s easy to become nearsighted: to equate 
“code” with “text in a file” or “programming” with “writing JavaScript 
in an IDE” without seeing the dizzying mathematical scope of the power 
we play with so casually.</p>

<h1 id="shannons-counting-argument">Shannon’s Counting Argument</h1>

<h2 id="naming-a-thing-gives-you-power-over-it">“Naming a thing gives you power over it”</h2>

<p>Every function over binary inputs can be modeled with a circuit of 
primitive logic gates, like AND/OR/NOT or NAND. Some functions, like a 
bitwise AND, are really easy to model with circuits, and can be 
constructed with a number of gates that is linear in the size of the 
input. Other functions are a little less friendly, and need a polynomial 
number of gates to model.</p>

<p>But there are <em>a lot</em> of possible functions. Even just considering boolean 
operations (that output only one bit), there are O(2^2^n) distinct 
mappings over n inputs. This absolutely dwarfs the O(2^n) functions you 
can model with n logic gates, which means that there just isn’t space 
for every function to have a polynomial-sized circuit. In fact, the vast 
majority of functions have to be content with enormous, exponentially 
huge circuits.</p>

<p>What’s weird is that even though we know that almost all boolean 
functions require exponentially large circuits, <em>we don’t know what any 
of them are</em>. Everything that we have a name for – every point in 
concept-space that humanity has ever touched – either fits into a 
polynomial circuit or has yet to be proven. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_complexity#History">We’re not even sure</a> 
if NP-complete problems like SAT or EXPTIME-complete problems like Go 
need exponentially large circuits!</p>

<p>The same counting argument applies to programming languages. While Lisp 
may be touted as pure revelation of functional enlightenment that 
encapsulates the true essence of computing, the disappointing reality is 
that the space of computation is just too big for any encoding – even 
lambda calculus – to efficiently capture anything more than an 
exponentially tiny fraction of it. Every language is good at succinctly
describing a small set of ideas, but there are just too many things that 
you could want to do with a computer for any language to be good at 
expressing all of them.</p>

<p>Rather tautologically, we don’t have any examples of things we don’t 
know to describe. But the fact that they have to exist – and that there 
are so many of them – should bother us.</p>

<p>It’s eerie: it doesn’t feel like we’re missing out, but the vast 
majority of possible “things” (functions, transformations, ideas) just 
haven’t been thought of, ever. It’s possible that they haven’t been 
thought of because they’re inherently nonsensical, random contortions of 
math that wouldn’t be useful, but I think it’s because we don’t have the 
right language to understand their significance. There might be a 
language in which AND is exponentially difficult to describe, but a 
brand new set of thoughts that elude us now become trivial. There could 
be world-changing, paradigm-shifting ideas hiding in the exponential 
shadows! We have the Turing-complete keys to unlock the entire 
computation-space, but we only see the polynomial tip of the 
computational iceberg. So why don’t we explore?</p>

  <p>“Most creativity is a transition from one context into another where 
  things are more surprising. There’s an element of surprise, and 
  especially in science, there is often laughter that goes along with 
  the “Aha.” Art also has this element. Our job is to remind us that 
  there are more contexts than the one that we’re in — the one that we 
  think is reality.” – Alan Kay</p>

<h1 id="goodharts-law">Goodhart’s Law</h1>

<h2 id="when-a-measure-becomes-a-target-it-ceases-to-be-a-good-measure">“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure”</h2>

<p>The SAT was momentarily a good test (this is the Scholastic Aptitude 
Test for now, not Satisfiability). Its purpose was to evaluate “college 
readiness”, and it was good at it. Even though the content of the test, 
like obscure vocabulary knowledge, wasn’t directly related to college 
readiness itself, the two were so closely correlated that they became 
interchangeable for evaluation purposes.</p>

<p>But! Abstractions leak, and systems interfere with each other. Quickly, 
students began to buy practice books and started memorizing obscure 
vocabulary directly, without the trouble of readying for college 
beforehand. Those convenient proxies that used to be correlated with 
college readiness because gameable, and the thing that the SAT really 
tested stopped being “college readiness” and became “proficiency at 
taking SAT tests”.</p>

<p>At first glance, ignoring the exponential majority of the “things” in 
the computation-verse might seem insignificant – after all, we’ve 
carefully designed our programming languages to expose everything 
imaginably useful through simple, human-readable metaphors like Objects 
or Functions. In fact, we’ve honed and sharpened these languages over 
dozens of iterations to really good at manipulating functions and 
objects and classes and strings and APIs.</p>

<p>But in the same way that the SAT mutated the system it was designed to 
evaluate through pressure from college admissions, I think that the 
computer science field is no longer about exploring computation, but 
rather about getting better and faster at the things with which we’re 
already familiar, through commercial incentives. While this is fine and 
admirable and even necessary for practical, real-world implementation, 
I think we’ve completely lost sight of the scope of the ideas that could 
be waiting to be discovered.</p>

<p>But who needs new ideas when there’s SEO and user engagement to 
optimize? Why would we need new languages when the ones we have a 
perfectly good for dark UI patterns and addictive conditioning?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is 
  to think that you know what you’re doing. Because once you think you 
  know what you’re doing, you stop looking around for other ways of 
  doing things.” – Bret Victor</p>

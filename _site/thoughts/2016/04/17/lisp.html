<div class="content">
    <p>“Computation” is a very slippery, mathematical idea. For convenience, 
we almost always interact with it by proxy: we talk about models of 
computation, individual little reductions and projections and 
simplifications like “Turing machines” or “Python scripts” that are just 
tiny peepholes – Turing-complete peepholes, but tiny nonetheless – into 
the raw, fluid information-space beyond.</p>

<h1 id="act-1-lisp-is-pure">Act 1: Lisp is pure</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know who discovered water, but it wasn’t a fish.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="opinionation">“Opinionation”</h2>

<p>The Lisp community likes to rant about Lisp’s “expressiveness” as proof 
of its superiority. But rather than discuss a language’s expressiveness 
– how large a window it has into the information-space – I think it’s 
more valuable to examine a language’s opinionation – how much structural 
baggage is required to frame the peephole. We can always chisel larger
windows by constructing abstractions, but opinions are dangerous because 
they stick, infect, and propagate.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/inception.jpg" alt="Inception" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the most resilient parasite?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are a couple of examples of these “imposed opinions”.</p>

<h3 id="typing">Typing</h3>
<p>Strongly typed languages attach the idea of units to every piece of 
information being manipulated. This isn’t to say it’s a bad thing – 
there are many advantages – but it’s an artificial concept that we 
overlaid on top of the underlying computation.</p>

<h3 id="object-orientation">Object-orientation</h3>
<p>Similarly, while a strict object-oriented metaphor like Smalltalk can be 
powerful, it’s still a metaphor for something much larger and much more 
powerful. The same statement can be made for Functional, Dataflow, or 
any of the other commonly discussed “paradigms”. They’re just sets of 
constraints for framing problems.</p>

<h3 id="lexicography">Lexicography</h3>
<p>People think that code is text in a file. Why? It makes sense – humans 
think well literally – so of course it was natural to name hexadecimal 
opcodes, and pile more natural linguistics on top of it. But visual, 
flow-chart or spreadsheet-based languages are equally valid. In fact, 
you can project information onto just about any human sense and call 
it a new programming paradigm.</p>

<h3 id="time">Time</h3>
<p>Now it’s getting fun! There’s nothing about the mathematical concept of 
computation that is time-dependent. If anything, computation encompasses 
time, not vice-versa. Even in complexity theory, we only use time to 
indirectly quantify a problem’s “hardness”. Yet every model of 
computation that we use has a rigid framework of synchronism: code is 
“executed” line-after-line, Turing machines follow an ordered series of 
steps, and CPUs iterate through discrete, sequential cycles.</p>

<h3 id="space">Space</h3>
<p>This is even weirder to think about than time. Information always exists 
as discrete chunks that “live” at addressable “locations”. Why? It’s 
convenient for working with in practical implementation and might be 
easier to conceptualize, but it’s not necessary. Memory addresses, 
variables, files, and even websites are all symptoms of this opinion.</p>

<h2 id="propagation">Propagation</h2>

<p>Typing and object-orientation aren’t dangerous opinions because everyone 
is aware that they are opinions, and that there are alternatives. That’s 
the way that they’re taught – that Object-oriented languages are good 
for some things, and Functional languages are good for other things, and 
that you should choose your language to reflect your domain. That’s 
awesome.</p>

<p>But what’s dangerous about some opinions is that, like a fish in water, 
we spend our entire lives immersed in them. And as a result, nobody 
realizes that they’re not inherent. Sequential, single-threaded 
execution began as a necessity in hardware but then propagated up 
through innumerable levels of abstraction to high-level languages – 
we’re hardly rid of it today! Why should the limitations of a hardware 
implementation constrain our mental models of programming? If 
Turing-reducibility is good for anything, it should be able to prune 
these limitations as we become increasingly abstract, not perpetuate 
them!</p>

<p>Yet relics of the constraints of lower levels are everywhere. Code and 
data are different things only because of the physical separation of 
circuits and the electricity that flows through them, but there’s no 
mathematical difference between information and a transformation 
thereof. Yet we’re still wiring static, compiled programs that are 
essentially glorified descriptions of circuits! Meanwhile, we haven’t 
needed keyboards since the invention of the touchscreen, but every 
interaction with a computer is still funneled through a ridiculously 
restrictive, serialized text stream. There are millions of pixels in our 
screens, and we can make any of them do anything at any time, but their 
most common use is to display the same alphabet that has been around for 
millennia. We have the technology to create a fully dynamic creative 
medium, but we’re still writing emails and reading dead, flat PDFs 
identical to the paper that preceded them. We’re even using text to 
compose images in Processing! <strong>How can we be so stupid!?</strong></p>

<p>Is it really surprising that we fail so painfully when trying to 
simulate other computational platforms, even when they should be 
theoretically within our reach?</p>

<p>Is it really surprising that distributed and parallel computation are so 
incredibly difficult?</p>

<p>Is it really surprising that “programming” has a stereotype of a 
prohibitively high learning barrier? That getting kids interesting in 
coding is so hard?</p>

<p>If we are going to advance computation – and I mean really advance, as 
in innovate, not iterate – we need to start critically evaluating and 
challenging the assumptions that we’ve made and the constraints that 
we’ve built our systems on. We need to stop propagating constraints that 
are only implementation-specific. Instead, our goal should be to 
systematically remove constraints and refine impurities with every level 
of abstraction.</p>

<h2 id="enter-lisp">Enter Lisp</h2>

<p>I haven’t explicitly said it yet, so here it: Lisp is the more pure, 
least constraining language humanity has ever invented.</p>

<p>Even having escaped the nebulous idea of “expressiveness”, this is still 
a difficult argument to make. How can we tell if Lisp is actually less 
opinionated, or just opinionated in a radically different direction than 
what we’re used to?</p>

<p>This semester at MIT I’m taking a class on symbolic programming from the 
infamous Gerry Sussman, creator of Scheme, author of SICP and SICM, and 
pioneer of Nerd Pride pocket protectors everywhere. The class itself is 
worthy of its own post, so I’ll defer that and replace this sentence 
with a link once I write it. Insert your favorite JavaScript Promise pun 
here.</p>

<p>Sussman is fond of repeating that Lisp is easy to learn, not because it 
has a simple syntax, but because it has <em>no</em> syntax. There no 
programmer-facing interface, no intermediate step: a Lisp program is a 
direct encoding of the abstract syntax tree of its own evaluation. It 
makes no assumptions about your data and imposes minimal constraints on 
your mental model (the largest of which is perhaps that lambda-calculus 
is inherently symbolic, which is quite hard to subvert). Lisp is the 
closest we come to directly manipulating information, getting a raw 
glimpse of naked computation, and the weird Zen nirvana that they’re the 
same thing. Cue any number of blog posts about the fabled 
“Lisp enlightenment”.</p>
